# Lyber


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


```
git clone https://github.com/terrenceliu/Lyber.git
```

### Installing

Set up the development environment.

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run Locally
```
npm run start
```

### Development setup

Under the project directory, open a new terminal and run
```
npm run watch
```

Open another new terminal and run
```
npm run start
```

The `watch` script turns on the watch mode. Webpack will continue to watch for changes in any of the resolved files. 

The `start` script will spawn a dev server which reloads the page when you save the files. The server runs at `http://localhost:8080` and will automatically open up.
