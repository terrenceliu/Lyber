# Lyber


## Getting Started



### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/terrenceliu/Lyber.git
cd Lyber
npm install
```

### Run Locally
```
npm run start
```

### Development setup

Under the project directory, open a new terminal and run
```
npm run watch
```

Open another new terminal and run
```
npm run start
```

The `watch` script turns on the watch mode. Webpack will continue to watch for changes in any of the resolved files. 

The `start` script will spawn a dev server which reloads the page when you save the files. The server runs at `http://localhost:8080` and will automatically open up.
